# Nodejs API with POSTGRESS database

This is a simple template i use for quickly starting up on a nodejs based api project which requires a relational database.
DB has only onle table. Hence, NO Joins :). That is upto you.

- We use `pg-migrate` for setting up schema.
- Graceful Shutdowns
- SQL prepared statements
- Repository pattern
- Pool object for better testing
- CRUD API
